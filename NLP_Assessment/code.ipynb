In\\nthis work, we explore a novel scenario: a conversation agent views a set of the\\nuser's photos (for example, from social media platforms) and asks an engaging\\nquestion to initiate a conversation with the user. The existing\\nvision-to-question models mostly generate tedious and obvious questions, which\\nmight not be ideals conversation starters. This paper introduces a two-phase\\nframework that first generates a visual story for the photo set and then uses\\nthe story to produce an interesting question. The human evaluation shows that\\nour framework generates more response-provoking questions for starting\\nconversations than other vision-to-question baselines.\\n\",\n          \"  We revisit large kernel design in modern convolutional neural networks\\n(CNNs). Inspired by recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs), in this\\npaper, we demonstrate that using a few large convolutional kernels instead of a\\nstack of small kernels could be a more powerful paradigm. We suggested five\\nguidelines, e.g., applying re-parameterized large depth-wise convolutions, to\\ndesign efficient high-performance large-kernel CNNs. Following the guidelines,\\nwe propose RepLKNet, a pure CNN architecture whose kernel size is as large as\\n31x31, in contrast to commonly used 3x3. RepLKNet greatly closes the\\nperformance gap between CNNs and ViTs, e.g., achieving comparable or superior\\nresults than Swin Transformer on ImageNet and a few typical downstream tasks,\\nwith lower latency. RepLKNet also shows nice scalability to big data and large\\nmodels, obtaining 87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 56.0% mIoU on ADE20K,\\nwhich is very competitive among the state-of-the-arts with similar model sizes.\\nOur study further reveals that, in contrast to small-kernel CNNs, large-kernel\\nCNNs have much larger effective receptive fields and higher shape bias rather\\nthan texture bias. Code & models at\\nhttps://github.com/megvii-research/RepLKNet.\\n\",\n          \"  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced considerably, intertwining\\nvisual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is not\\nonly coherent but also contextually attuned. Despite their success, LVLMs still\\nsuffer from the issue of object hallucinations, where models generate plausible\\nyet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To\\nmitigate this issue, we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a simple\\nand training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from\\noriginal and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the\\nover-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors, two essential causes of\\nobject hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely\\ngrounded to visual inputs, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our\\nexperiments show that VCD, without either additional training or the usage of\\nexternal tools, significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across\\ndifferent LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also\\nexcels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"InformationTheory\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ComputationalLinguistics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ComputerVision\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To avoid negative transfer, OSDA\\ncan be tackled by first separating the known/unknown target samples and then\\naligning known target samples with the source data. We propose a novel method\\nto addresses both these problems using the self-supervised task of rotation\\nrecognition. Moreover, we assess the performance with a new open set metric\\nthat properly balances the contribution of recognizing the known classes and\\nrejecting the unknown samples. Comparative experiments with existing OSDA\\nmethods on the standard Office-31 and Office-Home benchmarks show that: (i) our\\nmethod outperforms its competitors, (ii) reproducibility for this field is a\\ncrucial issue to tackle, (iii) our metric provides a reliable tool to allow\\nfair open set evaluation.\\n\",\n          \"  Predicting an athlete's performance based on short footage is highly\\nchallenging. Performance prediction requires high domain knowledge and enough\\nevidence to infer an appropriate quality assessment. Sports pundits can often\\ninfer this kind of information in real-time. In this paper, we propose\\nregressing an ultra-distance runner cumulative race time (CRT), i.e., the time\\nthe runner has been in action since the race start, by using only a few seconds\\nof footage as input. We modified the I3D ConvNet backbone slightly and trained\\na newly added regressor for that purpose. We use appropriate pre-processing of\\nthe visual input to enable transfer learning from a specific runner. We show\\nthat the resulting neural network can provide a remarkable performance for\\nshort input footage: 18 minutes and a half mean absolute error in estimating\\nthe CRT for runners who have been in action from 8 to 20 hours. Our methodology\\nhas several favorable properties: it does not require a human expert to provide\\nany insight, it can be used at any moment during the race by just observing a\\nrunner, and it can inform the race staff about a runner at any given time.\\n\",\n          \"  RGBT tracking has been widely used in various fields such as robotics,\\nsurveillance processing, and autonomous driving. Existing RGBT trackers fully\\nexplore the spatial information between the template and the search region and\\nlocate the target based on the appearance matching results. However, these RGBT\\ntrackers have very limited exploitation of temporal information, either\\nignoring temporal information or exploiting it through online sampling and\\ntraining. The former struggles to cope with the object state changes, while the\\nlatter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. To\\nalleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking\\nframework, named as TATrack. TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure\\nand captures temporal information by an online updated template, where the\\ntwo-stream structure refers to the multi-modal feature extraction and\\ncross-modal interaction for the initial template and the online update template\\nrespectively. TATrack contributes to comprehensively exploit spatio-temporal\\ninformation and multi-modal information for target localization. In addition,\\nwe design a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that bridges two\\nbranches and enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales.\\nExtensive experiments on three popular RGBT tracking benchmarks show that our\\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at real-time speed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ComputationalLinguistics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, INER faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting specific\\nfor incremental learning, further aggravated by background shift (i.e., old and\\nfuture entity types are labeled as the non-entity type in the current task). To\\naddress these challenges, we propose a method called task Relation Distillation\\nand Prototypical pseudo label (RDP) for INER. Specifically, to tackle\\ncatastrophic forgetting, we introduce a task relation distillation scheme that\\nserves two purposes: 1) ensuring inter-task semantic consistency across\\ndifferent incremental learning tasks by minimizing inter-task relation\\ndistillation loss, and 2) enhancing the model's prediction confidence by\\nminimizing intra-task self-entropy loss. Simultaneously, to mitigate background\\nshift, we develop a prototypical pseudo label strategy that distinguishes old\\nentity types from the current non-entity type using the old model. This\\nstrategy generates high-quality pseudo labels by measuring the distances\\nbetween token embeddings and type-wise prototypes. We conducted extensive\\nexperiments on ten INER settings of three benchmark datasets (i.e., CoNLL2003,\\nI2B2, and OntoNotes5). The results demonstrate that our method achieves\\nsignificant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods, with an\\naverage increase of 6.08% in Micro F1 score and 7.71% in Macro F1 score.\\n\",\n          \"  Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are an integral part of modern AI\\nthat have led to breakthrough performances in complex AI tasks. Major AI\\ncompanies with expensive infrastructures are able to develop and train these\\nlarge models with billions and millions of parameters from scratch. Third\\nparties, researchers, and practitioners are increasingly adopting these\\npre-trained models and fine-tuning them on their private data to accomplish\\ntheir downstream AI tasks. However, it has been shown that an adversary can\\nextract/reconstruct the exact training samples from these LLMs, which can lead\\nto revealing personally identifiable information. The issue has raised deep\\nconcerns about the privacy of LLMs. Differential privacy (DP) provides a\\nrigorous framework that allows adding noise in the process of training or\\nfine-tuning LLMs such that extracting the training data becomes infeasible\\n(i.e., with a cryptographically small success probability). While the\\ntheoretical privacy guarantees offered in most extant studies assume learning\\nmodels from scratch through many training iterations in an asymptotic setting,\\nthis assumption does not hold in fine-tuning scenarios in which the number of\\ntraining iterations is significantly smaller. To address the gap, we present\\n\\\\ewtune, a DP framework for fine-tuning LLMs based on Edgeworth accountant with\\nfinite-sample privacy guarantees. Our results across four well-established\\nnatural language understanding (NLU) tasks show that while \\\\ewtune~adds privacy\\nguarantees to LLM fine-tuning process, it directly contributes to decreasing\\nthe induced noise to up to 5.6\\\\% and improves the state-of-the-art LLMs\\nperformance by up to 1.1\\\\% across all NLU tasks. We have open-sourced our\\nimplementations for wide adoption and public testing purposes.\\n\",\n          \"  Previous methods for dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) in the wild\\nare mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), whose local\\noperations ignore the long-range dependencies in videos. Transformer-based\\nmethods for DFER can achieve better performances but result in higher FLOPs and\\ncomputational costs. To solve these problems, the local-global spatio-temporal\\nTransformer (LOGO-Former) is proposed to capture discriminative features within\\neach frame and model contextual relationships among frames while balancing the\\ncomplexity. Based on the priors that facial muscles move locally and facial\\nexpressions gradually change, we first restrict both the space attention and\\nthe time attention to a local window to capture local interactions among\\nfeature tokens. Furthermore, we perform the global attention by querying a\\ntoken with features from each local window iteratively to obtain long-range\\ninformation of the whole video sequence. In addition, we propose the compact\\nloss regularization term to further encourage the learned features have the\\nminimum intra-class distance and the maximum inter-class distance. Experiments\\non two in-the-wild dynamic facial expression datasets (i.e., DFEW and FERV39K)\\nindicate that our method provides an effective way to make use of the spatial\\nand temporal dependencies for DFER.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Despite the\\navailability of various detection techniques, limitations persist regarding\\ncost-effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability. Addressing these\\nshortcomings, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging an advanced\\nversion of the YOLOv8 object detection model, supplemented with a Convolutional\\nBlock Attention Module (CBAM) for improved feature recognition. The optimized\\nloss function further refines the learning process. Employing a dataset of\\n5,432 images from the Saemangeum offshore wind farm and a publicly available\\ndataset, our method underwent rigorous testing. The findings reveal a\\nsubstantial enhancement in defect detection stability, marking a significant\\nstride towards efficient turbine maintenance. This study's contributions\\nilluminate the path for future research, potentially revolutionizing\\nsustainable energy practices.\\n\",\n          \"  We propose the task of emotion style transfer, which is particularly\\nchallenging, as emotions (here: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise)\\nare on the fence between content and style. To understand the particular\\ndifficulties of this task, we design a transparent emotion style transfer\\npipeline based on three steps: (1) select the words that are promising to be\\nsubstituted to change the emotion (with a brute-force approach and selection\\nbased on the attention mechanism of an emotion classifier), (2) find sets of\\nwords as candidates for substituting the words (based on lexical and\\ndistributional semantics), and (3) select the most promising combination of\\nsubstitutions with an objective function which consists of components for\\ncontent (based on BERT sentence embeddings), emotion (based on an emotion\\nclassifier), and fluency (based on a neural language model). This comparably\\nstraight-forward setup enables us to explore the task and understand in what\\ncases lexical substitution can vary the emotional load of texts, how changes in\\ncontent and style interact and if they are at odds. We further evaluate our\\npipeline quantitatively in an automated and an annotation study based on Tweets\\nand find, indeed, that simultaneous adjustments of content and emotion are\\nconflicting objectives: as we show in a qualitative analysis motivated by\\nScherer's emotion component model, this is particularly the case for implicit\\nemotion expressions based on cognitive appraisal or descriptions of bodily\\nreactions.\\n\",\n          \"  Despite considerable recent progress, the creation of well-balanced and\\ndiverse resources remains a time-consuming and costly challenge in Argument\\nMining.

In this work,\\nwe perform a comprehensive discrimination-aware experimentation of deep\\nlearning-based face recognition. The main aim of this study is focused on a\\nbetter understanding of the feature space generated by deep models, and the\\nperformance achieved over different demographic groups. We also propose a\\ngeneral formulation of algorithmic discrimination with application to face\\nbiometrics. The experiments are conducted over the new DiveFace database\\ncomposed of 24K identities from six different demographic groups. Two popular\\nface recognition models are considered in the experimental framework: ResNet-50\\nand VGG-Face. We experimentally show that demographic groups highly represented\\nin popular face databases have led to popular pre-trained deep face models\\npresenting strong algorithmic discrimination. That discrimination can be\\nobserved both qualitatively at the feature space of the deep models and\\nquantitatively in large performance differences when applying those models in\\ndifferent demographic groups, e.g. for face biometrics.\\n\",\n          \"  Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become a hot topic in the field\\nof remote sensing. In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral\\ndata make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional\\nmachine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral imaging often deals with\\nan inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and\\nthe corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized\\nas a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems\\nand widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those\\nsuccessful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify\\nHSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic\\nreview of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares\\nseveral strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main\\nchallenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by\\ntraditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep\\nlearning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework which divides the\\ncorresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks,\\nand spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent\\nachievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition,\\nconsidering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing\\nfield are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large\\nnumber of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification\\nperformance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this\\ntopic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification\\nmethods are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.\\n\",\n          \"  We introduce the problem of proficiency modeling: Given a user's posts on a\\nsocial media platform, the task is to identify the subset of posts or topics\\nfor which the user has some level of proficiency. This enables the filtering\\nand ranking of social media posts on a given topic as per user proficiency.\\nUnlike experts on a given topic, proficient users may not have received formal\\ntraining and possess years of practical experience, but may be autodidacts,\\nhobbyists, and people with sustained interest, enabling them to make genuine\\nand original contributions to discourse. While predicting whether a user is an\\nexpert on a given topic imposes strong constraints on who is a true positive,\\nproficiency modeling implies a graded scoring, relaxing these constraints. Put\\nanother way, many active social media users can be assumed to possess, or\\neventually acquire, some level of proficiency on topics relevant to their\\ncommunity. We tackle proficiency modeling in an unsupervised manner by\\nutilizing user embeddings to model engagement with a given topic, as indicated\\nby a user's preference for authoring related content. We investigate five\\nalternative approaches to model proficiency, ranging from basic ones to an\\nadvanced, tailored user modeling approach, applied within two real-world\\nbenchmarks for evaluation.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In this work,\\nwe perform a comprehensive discrimination-aware experimentation of deep\\nlearning-based face recognition. The main aim of this study is focused on a\\nbetter understanding of the feature space generated by deep models, and the\\nperformance achieved over different demographic groups. We also propose a\\ngeneral formulation of algorithmic discrimination with application to face\\nbiometrics. The experiments are conducted over the new DiveFace database\\ncomposed of 24K identities from six different demographic groups. Two popular\\nface recognition models are considered in the experimental framework: ResNet-50\\nand VGG-Face. We experimentally show that demographic groups highly represented\\nin popular face databases have led to popular pre-trained deep face models\\npresenting strong algorithmic discrimination. That discrimination can be\\nobserved both qualitatively at the feature space of the deep models and\\nquantitatively in large performance differences when applying those models in\\ndifferent demographic groups, e.g. for face biometrics.\\n\",\n          \"  Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become a hot topic in the field\\nof remote sensing. In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral\\ndata make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional\\nmachine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral imaging often deals with\\nan inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and\\nthe corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized\\nas a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems\\nand widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those\\nsuccessful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify\\nHSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic\\nreview of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares\\nseveral strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main\\nchallenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by\\ntraditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep\\nlearning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework which divides the\\ncorresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks,\\nand spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent\\nachievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition,\\nconsidering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing\\nfield are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large\\nnumber of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification\\nperformance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this\\ntopic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification\\nmethods are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.\\n\",\n          \"  We introduce the problem of proficiency modeling: Given a user's posts on a\\nsocial media platform, the task is to identify the subset of posts or topics\\nfor which the user has some level of proficiency. This enables the filtering\\nand ranking of social media posts on a given topic as per user proficiency.\\nUnlike experts on a given topic, proficient users may not have received formal\\ntraining and possess years of practical experience, but may be autodidacts,\\nhobbyists, and people with sustained interest, enabling them to make genuine\\nand original contributions to discourse. While predicting whether a user is an\\nexpert on a given topic imposes strong constraints on who is a true positive,\\nproficiency modeling implies a graded scoring, relaxing these constraints. Put\\nanother way, many active social media users can be assumed to possess, or\\neventually acquire, some level of proficiency on topics relevant to their\\ncommunity. We tackle proficiency modeling in an unsupervised manner by\\nutilizing user embeddings to model engagement with a given topic, as indicated\\nby a user's preference for authoring related content. We investigate five\\nalternative approaches to model proficiency, ranging from basic ones to an\\nadvanced, tailored user modeling approach, applied within two real-world\\nbenchmarks for evaluation.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
